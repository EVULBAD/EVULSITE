            TERMS OF SERVICE<br>
            Terms are subject to change if discussed with me prior to accepting payment.<br>
            To contact me for any reason, please email at evulbad@gmail.com.<br>
            <br>
            GENERAL TERMS<br>
            I have the right to refuse commissions at my discretion. I also have the right to, for any reason, cancel a commission that has already been accepted; 
            in this event, the purchaser will receive notification and a full refund. I reserve the right
            to make use of the concepts within cancelled commissions (such as poses, environments, color 
            schemes, etc) for profit upon removal of the character design requested by 
            purchaser of cancelled commission.<br>
            I reserve the rights to produced commissions, and am thus allowed to display it online, in portfolios, in galleries, and for promotion.<br>
            You may use your commission for personal use only. Your commission may not be used for 
            any form of profit unless terms are discussed prior. You may not claim your commission as
            art that you made. You may display your commission online so long as I am given credit via
            mention of my username, "EVULBAD".<br>
            By purchasing a commission, you agree that you are at least 18 years of age. If you lie about 
            your age, you will be blacklisted.<br>
            Commissions are accepted in a first come, first served basis.
            Commission slots are held for a total of 24 hours after receiving approval. If you can 
            not pay in that time, your slot will go to the next person in line.<br>
            Rush order commissions are to be finished within two weeks following receipt of payment, and
            will take priority over other commissions in queue.<br>
            <br>
            PROGESS<br>
            While turn-around is heavily dependent on queue, complexity of commissions in said queue, and my life outside 
            of art, commissions may take up to 5 months to complete once started. By default, I provide only one progress update upon finishing the sketch.
            You may request more progress updates at any point in time, however, I do not work on 
            commissions every single day, and cannot guarantee significant day-to-day progress.<br>
            <br>
            PAYMENT AND REFUNDS<br>
            All payment is upfront and full through Square. I will not start a commission until full payment is received.
            There are no rain-checks; if you have purchased a commission from me in the past at a cheaper 
            price and my prices have since risen, you will not get any new commissions at those 
            old prices.<br>
            Full refunds as requested by purchaser are only permitted under the following simultaneous 
            conditions:<br>
            1. It has been 3 months since payment was received.<br>
            2. There has not been any progress upon commission in that time.<br>
            If your commission is a rush order that is not finished within the promised 2 week timespan, 
            I will refund the rush order fee and offer a partial refund for whatever work 
            I have not yet completed.<br>
            <br>
            EDITS<br>
            Once commission is finished, I will provide only one major edit when requested. Edits will only be provided if requested up to a week afterward.
            Any edits requested after commission has been finished for one week may be provided alongside additional fees.
