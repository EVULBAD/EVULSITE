                    <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
                    Effective November 11, 2023.<br>
                    Terms are subject to change if discussed with me prior to accepting payment.<br>
                    To contact me for any reason, please email evulbad@gmail.com.<br>
                    By purchasing a commission, you agree to these terms and that you are at least 18 years of age.<br>
                    Violating these terms will result in being blacklisted.<br><br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>DEFINITIONS</h2>
                    The client - the individual purchasing the commission.<br>
                    The artist - the individual producing the commission ("EVULBAD").<br><br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>1. GENERAL TERMS</h2>
                    The artist reserves the right to refuse commissions at their discretion.<br><br>
                    The artist reserves the right to, for any reason, cancel a commission that has already been accepted or started; in this event, the client will receive notification and a partial refund for whatever work the artist has not yet completed. The artist reserves the right to make use of the concepts within cancelled commissions (such as poses, environments, color schemes, etc) for profit upon removal of the client's requested subject(s).<br><br>
                    The artist reserves the rights to produced commissions, and is thus allowed to display them online, on stream, in portfolios, in galleries, and for promotion. If the client needs their commission to be private for a certain amount of time (such as for birthdays, holidays, or debuts), this can be discussed so long as the artist is made aware before the client's commission is started. Fees may apply. The artist never shares layered or 3D model files publically; those are shared privately with the client by request. <br><br>
                    The client may not claim their commission as art that they made. They may display their commission online so long as the artist is given clear credit.<br><br>
                    Rush order commissions are to be completed within one week following receipt of payment and
                    will take priority over other commissions in the queue.<br><br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>2. COMMERCIAL USE</h2>
                    Commissions may not be used for profit or commercial use unless terms are discussed prior. Commercial use includes (but is not limited to):<br>
                    &emsp;• Merchandise<br>
                    &emsp;• Advertisements<br>
                    &emsp;• NFT minting<br>
                    &emsp;• Use in business or promotional materials such as logos, banners, flyers, posters, etc<br>
                    &emsp;• Use in media such as games, books, albums, video thumbnails, livestreams, etc<br><br>
                    Variable fees will apply if the client wishes to use the artist's work for commercial use. If the client decides they would like to use their commission for commercial use after it is already completed, they must contact the artist to discuss new terms before participating in any activity that utilizes the artist's work for the client's financial gain.<br><br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>3. PAYMENT AND REFUNDS</h2>
                    Payment is up front through Square invoices. It is expected to be paid in full unless the client's commission exceeds $200; in this case, the client may request to split the cost into two 50% payments, with one payment being due up front and the other being due once the commission is 50% complete.<br><br>
                    Commission slots are held for a total of 48 hours after receiving approval. If the client can 
                    not pay the agreed upon amount in that time, their slot will go to the next person in line.<br><br>
                    If the client has purchased a commission from the artist in the past at a cheaper price and prices have since risen, the client will not get any new commissions at those 
                    old prices.<br><br>
                    Refunds requested by the client are not permitted after the commission is started.<br><br>
                    If the client's commission is a rush order that is not completed within the promised one week timespan, 
                    the artist will refund the rush order fee and offer a partial refund for whatever work 
                    the artist has not yet completed.<br><br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>4. PROGRESS</h2>
                    By default, the only progress update provided occurs when the artist finishes the sketch.
                    The client may request more progress updates at any point in time; however, significant day-to-day progress is not guaranteed. The artist reserves the right to refuse to share a progress update if no significant progress has been made.<br><br>
                    The artist will provide updates regarding timing or delays as necessary.<br><br>
                    Due to highly variable complexity and life circumstances, some pieces may take up to 8 weeks to complete.<br><br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>5. EDITS</h2>
                    Upon request, the artist will provide one edit within reason to a completed commission under the condition that said edit is requested less than one week after the commission is completed.<br><br>
                    Any edits requested after the commission has been completed for one week may be provided alongside additional variable fees.
