            TERMS OF SERVICE<br>
            Terms are subject to change if discussed with me prior to accepting payment.<br>
            To contact me for any reason, please email at evulbad@gmail.com.<br>
            <br>
            GENERAL TERMS<br>
            I reserve the right to refuse commissions at my discretion.<br>
            I reserve the right to, for any reason, cancel a commission that has already been accepted; in this event, the purchaser will receive notification and a full refund. I reserve the right to make use of the concepts within cancelled commissions (such as poses, environments, color schemes, etc) for profit upon removal of the purchaser's requested character.<br>
            I reserve the rights to produced commissions, and am thus allowed to display it online, in portfolios, in galleries, and for promotion.<br>
            Commissions may not be used for profit or commercial use unless terms are discussed prior. Commercial use includes, but is not limited to:<br>
            &emsp;• Merchandise<br>
            &emsp;• Advertisements<br>
            &emsp;• NFT minting<br>
            &emsp;• Use in business materials such as logos, banners, flyers, etc<br>
            &emsp;• Use in media such as games, books, album covers, etc<br>
            You may not claim your commission as art that you made. You may display your commission online so long as I am given clear credit.<br>
            By purchasing a commission, you agree that you are at least 18 years of age.<br>
            Commission slots are held for a total of 48 hours after receiving approval. If you can 
            not pay in that time, your slot will go to the next person in line.<br>
            Rush order commissions are to be finished within two weeks following receipt of payment, and
            will take priority over other commissions in queue.<br>
            <br>
            PROGESS<br>
            By default, the only progress update I provide occurs when I finish the sketch.
            You may request more progress updates at any point in time; however, I do not work on 
            commissions every single day, and cannot guarantee significant day-to-day progress.<br>
            <br>
            PAYMENT AND REFUNDS<br>
            All payment is up front and full through Square. I will not start a commission until full payment is received.<br>
            There are no rain-checks; if you have purchased a commission from me in the past at a cheaper 
            price and my prices have since risen, you will not get any new commissions at those 
            old prices.<br>
            Full refunds (as requested by purchaser) are only permitted under the following simultaneous 
            conditions:<br>
            1. It has been 3 months since payment was received.<br>
            2. There has not been any progress upon commission in that time.<br>
            If your commission is a rush order that is not finished within the promised 2 week timespan, 
            I will refund the rush order fee and offer a partial refund for whatever work 
            I have not yet completed.<br>
            <br>
            EDITS<br>
            Upon request, I will provide one major edit to a finished commission under the condition that said edit is requested less than one week after the commission is finished.<br>
            Any edits requested after the commission has been finished for one week may be provided alongside additional fees.
